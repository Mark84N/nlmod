# nlmod
Dummy module + userspace app, a prototype of a custom NL messages processing.

I'm gonna to make kinda skeleton for possible future usage (and finally get familiar with generic NL).
NL API is a bit complicated and I must admit a lack of good step-by-step guide (especially low-level managing in userspace).

After finishing this dummy prototype I'd like to write the same userspace app but using libnl API.
